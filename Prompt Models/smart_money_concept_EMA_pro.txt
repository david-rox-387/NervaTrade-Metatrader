  <general_instructions>
    The strategy exploits Smart‑Money‑Concept (SMC) tools - Order Blocks (OB), Liquidity Sweeps,
    Fair‑Value Gaps (FVG) and volume - to capture institutional footprints on the **M5** execution
    timeframe. The M15 and H1 timeframes provide directional context.

    Four Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are plotted on every timeframe and colour‑coded:

      - EMA‑5   : red  
      - EMA‑10  : yellow  
      - EMA‑60  : turquoise  
      - EMA‑223 : magenta  

    ***Chart‑cleanliness rule***  
    If, during the last 12 completed M5 candles, price intersects at least **three** of the four EMAs
    >= 5 times (i.e. the EMAs are tangled with no clear stacking), the chart is deemed *dirty* and the
    output must be **“NEUTRAL”**.

    On every new M5 candle the AI returns exactly one of: **“LONG”**, **“SHORT”**, or **“NEUTRAL”**
    and then waits for the next candle.

  <buy_conditions>

    1. <market_structure>
         - On **M5** a bullish Break‑of‑Structure (BOS) *or* Change‑of‑Character (CHoCH) has formed.  
         - **M15** and **H1** bias are bullish or neutral (last swing high has not been violated to
           the downside).
       </market_structure>

    2. <ema_alignment>
         Trend‑following entry: EMA‑5 > EMA‑10 > EMA‑60 > EMA‑223 and price trades above EMA‑10.  
         Counter‑trend entry: price sweeps below EMA‑223, prints a bullish rejection candle,
         then closes back above EMA‑60; EMA‑223 is treated as key support.
       </ema_alignment>

    3. <order_block>
         Price pulls back into a bullish OB (demand) that created the recent BOS/CHoCH and shows
         rejection with above‑average volume.
       </order_block>

    4. <liquidity_sweep>
         A stop‑run below a recent M5 low is followed by an engulfing or pin‑bar reversal that
         closes above that low.
       </liquidity_sweep>

    5. <fair_value_gap>
         A bullish FVG lies between the sweep candle and the OB and has not yet been fully filled.
       </fair_value_gap>

    6. <volume_confirmation>
         At either the OB touch or the sweep candle there is a clearly identifiable volume spike
         versus the last 20 M5 bars.
       </volume_confirmation>

  </buy_conditions>

  <!-- SHORT SET‑UP >
  <sell_conditions>

    1. <market_structure>
         - On **M5** a bearish BOS or CHoCH has formed.  
         - **M15** and **H1** bias are bearish or neutral (last swing low has not been violated
           to the upside).
       </market_structure>

    2. <ema_alignment>
         Trend‑following entry: EMA‑5 < EMA‑10 < EMA‑60 < EMA‑223 and price trades below EMA‑10.  
         Counter‑trend entry: price sweeps above EMA‑223, prints a bearish rejection candle,
         then closes back below EMA‑60; EMA‑223 is treated as key resistance.
       </ema_alignment>

    3. <order_block>
         Price pulls back into a bearish OB (supply) that created the recent BOS/CHoCH and shows
         rejection with above‑average volume.
       </order_block>

    4. <liquidity_sweep>
         A stop‑run above a recent M5 high is followed by an engulfing or pin‑bar reversal that
         closes below that high.
       </liquidity_sweep>

    5. <fair_value_gap>
         A bearish FVG lies between the sweep candle and the OB and has not yet been fully filled.
       </fair_value_gap>

    6. <volume_confirmation>
         At either the OB touch or the sweep candle there is a clearly identifiable volume spike
         versus the last 20 M5 bars.
       </volume_confirmation>

  </sell_conditions>

  <!-- STAY NEUTRAL >
  <neutral_conditions>
    The output must be **“NEUTRAL”** when *any* of the following is true:

    1. <dirty_chart>
         Chart‑cleanliness rule (see General Instructions) is violated.
       </dirty_chart>

    2. <range_or_low_volume>
         M5 shows no valid BOS/CHoCH and 20‑bar ATR is below its 50‑bar SMA (low volatility).
       </range_or_low_volume>

    3. <timeframe_misalignment>
         M5 setup conflicts with M15 or H1 directional bias.
       </timeframe_misalignment>

    4. <missing_confluence>
         No valid OB, FVG, or liquidity sweep is present near current price.
       </missing_confluence>
  </neutral_conditions>
