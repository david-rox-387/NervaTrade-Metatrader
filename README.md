## The Rise of AI Vibe Trading

Trading has evolved beyond traditional technical analysis into a new paradigm: AI-driven vibe trading. This innovative approach leverages the power of artificial intelligence to capture market sentiment and identify opportunities that conventional strategies might miss.

### What is Vibe Trading?

Vibe trading represents the next evolution in financial market analysis - using advanced AI to detect subtle patterns and "vibes" in market movements that are invisible to human traders. By processing vast amounts of data across multiple timeframes, NervaTrade's algorithms can sense shifts in market psychology before they manifest in price.

### How Vibe Trading Works

1. **Express Your Strategy**
   - Describe your trading approach in natural language, just as you would explain it to another trader
   - No coding knowledge required - simply write what you want in plain English

2. **AI Translation**
   - N.E.R.V.A. translates your prompts into sophisticated, executable trading algorithms
   - Complex strategies are implemented without writing a single line of code

3. **Automated Execution**
   - Your strategy runs automatically, removing human bias and emotion from decision-making
   - The system adapts to changing market conditions based on your defined parameters

### NervaTrade's AI Advantage

NervaTrade sits at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and financial markets:

- **Advanced Pattern Recognition**: Our neural networks identify complex correlations that traditional indicators cannot detect
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Simultaneous evaluation of multiple timeframes provides deeper market context
- **Adaptive Learning**: The system continuously improves by analyzing its own performance
- **Sentiment Integration**: Market sentiment is factored into every trading decision

By deploying these AI capabilities through MetaTrader 5, we've democratized access to institutional-grade trading technology, allowing retail traders to compete on a level playing field with professionals.

## Regular vs. Tester Version

This repository includes two versions of the Expert Advisor:

### NervaTradeAI.ex5
- The standard version for live trading on real or demo accounts
- Uses a specific UI library for its interface
- Cannot be used in the MetaTrader 5 Strategy Tester due to interface library incompatibility

### NervaTradeAI_TESTER.ex5
- Specifically designed for backtesting in MetaTrader 5 Strategy Tester
- Includes manual trading buttons in the interface to open positions during testing
- Uses a different UI library compatible with the Strategy Tester
- Functionally identical to the standard version in terms of trading logic and strategy

**Note:** Both versions offer the same trading functionality and strategy implementation. The only difference is in the interface library used, which affects their compatibility with the Strategy Tester.

## System Architecture

NervaTradeAI is built on a sophisticated event-driven architecture that integrates multiple components to create a robust trading system. The diagram below illustrates the high-level structure and relationships between the key components:

![NervaTradeAI System Architecture](docs/diagram.png)

The NervaTradeAI system utilizes an event-driven architecture where components communicate through a central event dispatching system. This design provides several advantages:

1. **Loose Coupling**: Components interact through events rather than direct calls, making the system more modular and maintainable.

2. **Extensibility**: New components can be added by implementing the IEventListener interface and subscribing to relevant events.

3. **Separation of Concerns**: 
   - **Entry Strategies**: Handle trade entry signals from API or manual inputs
   - **Exit Strategies**: Manage position exits through trailing stops and adaptive position adjustment
   - **Risk Management**: Control position sizing, spread monitoring, and drawdown protection
   - **API Integration**: Connect to external trading signal providers with neural pattern recognition
   - **Trading Utilities**: Provide market data and order execution functionality with volatility analysis
   - **Notification System**: Send alerts and manage communications

4. **Advanced Analysis Components**:
   - **Neural Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring market patterns using machine learning
   - **Market Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluates market emotions and sentiment indicators
   - **Volatility Analysis**: Calculates and normalizes volatility across timeframes
   - **Position Size Management**: Optimizes trade size based on risk parameters

5. **Singleton Pattern**: Key components are implemented as singletons to ensure a single point of responsibility and state management across the system.

6. **Dual Interface Mode**: 
   - Regular version with full GUI for live trading
   - Tester version with manual controls for backtesting

This architecture allows the system to handle complex trading scenarios while maintaining code organization and enabling future enhancements.
